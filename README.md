# Worldcup

Welcome to your new gem, Worldcup info app! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/worldcup`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/worldcup_run` for an interactive prompt.



## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'worldcup'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install worldcup

## Usage

Upon running 'bin/worldcup_run' in your terminal, you will be presented a welcome message, then list of commands for easy guide into the app. Next, the app will be waiting to take your input on what you would like to do. At this point and any time after that  an input will be asked. An invalid entry will take you back to new input. An input is not a case-sensetive. Once it takes your input which is other than 'exit', it will bring desired information on your screen via terminal. An "exit" command will always close down the app. 
Since there is so much information scraped from different web pages, some steps might take longer than others, so be patient. If you get a 'time-out' error, you may want to restart the app. Have fun!!!

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
